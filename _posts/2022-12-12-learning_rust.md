# Learning Rust

## Why Learn Another Language

Well.. I won't be using it for work. That's for sure. Why learn it then?
1. For fun. I went in to this business because I like learning, thinking and
programming. Finding new, cooler ways of doing things is fun.
2. To learn new ways of thinking. I specifically look for languages which are
not "better C++"s. I want a language with a different concept. Different 
abstractions. If higher level languages limit some aspect of the programming task
by taking over it, then different languages can take over different aspects,
making you think differently about problems.
3. For fun.
4. Procrastination.. `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`

## What's so different about Rust

I'll elaborate some more about concepts that are new *to me* in following posts.
The list include:
* The borrow checker and its rules
* Pattern matchers
* Functional programming aspects (not really unique, but new to me)

Other aspects that make it fun:
* Cargo
* The amazing documentation
* The miriad of crates and the ease of adding them to a project.

To be continued.. (hopefully)
