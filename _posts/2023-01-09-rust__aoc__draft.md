## Here are my thought after solving some Advent of Code challenges using Rust

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is a fun annual game, played in december, where each day a programming challenge is published and the compatitors try to solve it as fast as possible.

Many compatitors don't actually go for speed, but use it as an opportunity to sharpen their skills or learn a new language.

I found out about this game in the middle of Nov. 2022 and immediately realized I want to use it as a Rust beginners exercise. I started working on 2021's puzzles while waiting for 2022 to start and then continue working in parallel until I ran out of time for both.

Each puzzle consists of 2 parts, where the 2nd part is only available after solving the first part. Each part solved awards a start. I scored a total of 76 stars at the time of writing this post. Currently I ran out of time to work on it, so for the forseeable future, this is my score.
